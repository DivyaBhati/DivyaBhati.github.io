		<div class = "About">
				Hey!  I'm a Sophomore in CS at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with plans on graduating in 2020.   I'm proficient in C++, Python, Java, and HTML+CSS.  For fun I love playing basketball, creating motion designs in After Effects/Photoshop, and trying new restaurants with friends.  To see my resume, GitHub, LinkedIn, or to send me an email check out the navbar below.

						ATS is a project that myself and an assigned group chose to work on for CS 196.  The goal of this project is to develop a website in which a user can enter two stock symbols and specify a time period to analyze them over.  The user will then get presented with a graph displaying the stocks over the specified period along with an analysis of any possible correlation between the stocks.  For now we don't have a registered domain for the site but you can download it from the <a href="https://github.com/danielferriss/ATS">repository</a> and run it from your computer!

						PONG++ is a personal project I developed in C++ using openFrameworks.  This allowed me to utilize several external libraries for me to use custom fonts and images.  I created the game sprites from scratch in Adobe Photoshop.  The game can be played between two users or against a CPU, and I also enabled several color schemes to choose from.  Check out the <a href="https://github.com/DivyaBhati/Pong">repository</a> to play it yourself!
